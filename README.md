# Style-Free Audio Player

## A lightweight style-free audio player.

A smooth user experience hinges on consistency. Every time you break from your brand's styleguide to include an external widget, you're adding inconsistency.

The **Style-Free Audio Player (SFAP)** aims to solve this problem for audio players. You bring the markup, you bring the CSS, SFAP brings the functionality.
